Tools for building multimedia pipelines at the commandline

This will hopefully become a collection of tools for generatig Multimedia pipelines on the commandline. For this we use a custom container format (gavf), which is basically a simple serialization of the internal structures. We plan to support zero-copy modes, where the actual data are in SHM-Segments, DMA-Buffers or similar.

Right now, this package is not useful for anything.
